1.  console.log('values added: ', result); = 20

2.  console.log('final result: ', result); = 20

3. console.log('values added: ', result); = 20 

4. console.log('final result: ', result); = error, variable is not in scope because let end scope will end with if statement.

5. console.log('values added: ', result); = error, cannot modify a constant value, so error

6. console.log('final result: ', result); = error, variable is not in scope, as it ends with if statement

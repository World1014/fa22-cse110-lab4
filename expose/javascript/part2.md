1.  console.log(i); = 3

2.  console.log(discountedPrice); = 150

3.  console.log(finalPrice); = 150

4.  This function will return an array of ints being [50, 100, 150].

5.  This will cause an error because the variable "i" will become out of scope when the loop ends. This will cause an error because there will be no usable variable named "i".

6.  This will cause an error because the variable "discountedPrice" will become out of scope when the loop ends. This will cause an error because there will be no usable variable named "discountedPrice". 

7.  console.log(finalPrice); = 150

8.  This function will return an array of ints being [50, 100, 150].

9.  This will cause an error because the variable "i" will become out of scope when the loop ends. This will cause an error because there will be no usable variable named "i".

10. console.log(length) = 3

11. This function will return an array of ints being [50, 100, 150].

12. A) student.name
    B) student.['Grad Year']
    C) student.greeting()
    D) student.['Favorite Teacher'].name
    E) student.courseLoad[0]

13. A) 32, this appended 2 to the end of the string 3.
    B) 1, treats 3 as an int so it subtracts
    C) 3, treats null as 0
    D) 3null, appends to the end
    E) 4, treats true as 1, so add
    F) 0, both are treated as 0 so add them
    G) 3undefined, appends to the end as string
    H) null, because undefined is not a number

14. A) true, treats string as a number for comparison
    B) false, because it is a string comparison, so it compared 2 < 1, so that is false
    C) true, both are treated as ints
    D) false, because the types are different
    E) false, because true is 1, so 1 != 2
    F) true, because Boolean(2) is one, so 1 == 1.

15. == checks for equality between the two values, while === checks for equality as well as equality of data types.

17. We can see that starting off in the loop we are looping through the given array, and using the callback to doSomething() to modify the array and write it into a new array. doSomething() will just take each number and multiply it by 2, so our newArr that will be returned will be: [2,4,6]. 

19. The output of this function will be: 1, 4, 3, 2.
